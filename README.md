## Lessons Learned

I am on my second year in College when I first got exposed to web development. My professor saw the potential on me and decided to give me this project. At first, I hesitated as I don't really know the workaround with full stack web. But then decided to face my fear and grab this opportunity.

While building this project, I learned the flow of web development - from frontend to backend, how to setup working environment like VS Code, XAMPP, and git, how to create database schema and diagrams, use libraries like AdminLTE, DataTables, and the spinning wheel, use frameworks (Codeigniter), what is MVC, and many more that I don't know how to do at first but did it anyway.

One of the challenges I encountered building this application are errors. But I solved this problem through documentation and stackoverflow. But, I got drained by solving errors where there are times that I am having a dream of it LOL! But one of the biggest challenge I encountered in this project is the changing requirements of the client. I am solo in making this application so I did all the work. After I made a working prototype, client keep changing or adding features which made my code worse - so I decided to use git (I think its called branch/branching). Its really troublesome for me because after I made something, they will then decided to "I guess we don't need it anymore" or "lets change the design" or "lets add this and that" ... So then I took note of this challenge so I can become more prepared with it next time. The solution I made for this is to plan out and seek meeting with the client, create wireframe and UI design, then build the prototype, and so on (Incremental Software Methodology).
